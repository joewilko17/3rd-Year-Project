# CulinaryCraftsman

**CulinaryCraftsman** is a recipe recommendation web application developed as part of a software engineering project. The platform leverages user-selected ingredients to provide personalized, health-focused recipe recommendations, aiming to promote better eating habits through an intuitive, user-friendly interface.

**Coming Soon:** see my Portfolio Website ([joewilko17.github.io](https://joewilko17.github.io/)) for more content about how I have made this project, why I have made it and how I want to expand the project in the future.

## Features

- **Ingredient-Based Recommendations**: Recipes are suggested based on the user's ingredient selections, dietary preferences, and restrictions.
- **Personalized Profiles**: Users can create accounts to save preferences, dietary restrictions, and favorite recipes.
- **Dynamic Recipe Display**: A concise and clean layout presents recipe information with minimal text, focusing on usability.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: User feedback is integrated into the recommendation algorithm for improving future suggestions.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML5, CSS3
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Recommendation System**: Content-Based Filtering algorithm

## Key Objectives

1. Develop a user-friendly full-stack application.
2. Implement a recommendation system utilizing a deep-learning algorithm.
3. Build a profile system for personalized interactions.
4. Incorporate user feedback to refine recommendations.

## Future Plans

In my next update of this project, I am planning on updating the following features:
- **Overhauled UI Design**: The project needs a UI overhaul as I have learnt a lot over the past few months, and I can do a much cleaner & modern job.
- **AI API Integration**: I want to swap the current attempt at a recommendation algorithm, and use the opportunity to implement an AI API to handle the recommendation system, until my future plans of exploring machine-learning in more detail. 

## How to Run

Currently the project is bugged due to broken dependencies, and I am not able to revert to my previous version as I am away from my main project workstation, and I do not have access to the files, but I plan on fixing this **ASAP**.
